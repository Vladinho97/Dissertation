        <h2>Participant Information Sheet</h2>
        <br>
        <h5> <strong>Project title: </strong> Incremental implicit learning of statistical bundles using stark contextual cues <br> <br>
        <strong> Principle Investigator: </strong> Chris Lucas <br> <br>
        <strong> Researcher collecting data: </strong> Vlad Iordan </h5> <br>

          <p>This study was certified according to the Informatics Research Ethics Process, RT number 2019/97784. <br> Please take time to read the following information carefully. You should keep this page for your records. </p>
        <h5> Who are the researchers? </h5>
          <p>The researchers are Vlad Iordan (Student at University of Edinburgh) and his Honours Project supervisor, Chris Lucas (Lecturer in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh).</p>
          <h5>What is the purpose of the study? </h5>
          <p> We are testing how humans can predict and influence throws of a dice. We have chosen to do this in the form of a video game, which you will interact with if you agree to take part in this study. </p>
          <h5> Why have I been asked to take part?</h5>
          <p> This research is available to anybody who is able to use a computer. We consider that being an AMT Worker qualifies you for this task. </p>
          <h5> Do I have to take part? </h5>
          <p> No – participation in this study is entirely up to you. You can withdraw from the study at any time, without giving a reason. Your rights will not be affected. If you wish to withdraw, contact the PI. We will stop using your data in any publications or presentations submitted after you have withdrawn consent. However, we will keep copies of your original consent, and of your withdrawal request. </p>
          <h5> What will happen if I decide to take part? </h5>
          <p> We will only collect interactions with the game along with the Mechanical Turk ID, which will be used to stop repeated play. The duration of the session depends on how fast you play, but we expect it to be around 20 minutes. No audio/video will be recorded. </p>
          <h5> Compensation</h5>
          <p> You will receive a base payment of $1.5 if you choose to participate and finish the experiment. Afterwards, based on your performance, you will receive a further bonus which usually ranges between $0.5 and $1.6 </p>
          <h5> Are there any risks associated with taking part? </h5>
          <p> There are no significant risks associated with participation. </p>
          <h5> What will happen to the results of this study? </h5>
          <p> The results of this study may be summarised in published articles, reports and presentations. Quotes or key findings will be anonymized: We will remove any information that could, in our assessment, allow anyone to identify you. With your consent, information can also be used for future research. Your data may be archived for a minimum of 2 years. </p>
          <h5>What do we collect?</h5>
          <p>We record your interactions with our user
          interface, such as mouse clicks, and demographic
          information like your gender and age (which you can decline to provide).</p>
          <h5> Data protection and confidentiality. </h5>
          <p> Your data will be processed in accordance with Data Protection Law.  All information collected about you will be kept strictly confidential. Your data will be referred to by a unique participant number rather than by name. Your data will only be viewed by the research team. </p>
          <p> All electronic data will be stored on a password-protected encrypted computer, on the School of Informatics’ secure file servers, or on the University’s secure encrypted cloud storage services (DataShare, ownCloud, or Sharepoint) and all paper records will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in the PI’s office. Your consent information will be kept separately from your responses in order to minimise risk.  </p>
          <h5> What are my data protection rights? </h5>
          <p> The University of Edinburgh is a Data Controller for the information you provide.  You have the right to access information held about you.
