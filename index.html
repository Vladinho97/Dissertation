          <h4>What do we collect?</h4>
          <p>We record your interactions with our user
          interface, such as mouse clicks, and demographic
          information like your gender and age (which you can decline to provide).</p><p>In order to keep track of experiment participation, for example to make sure that people don't participate in the same
          experiment more than once, we record AMT worker IDs. To allow us to troubleshoot potential technical problems, we store information about the browser version you're using, and what country
          you're visiting our site from.</p>
          <h4>What do we share?</h4>
